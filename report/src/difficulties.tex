\section{SOAP vs REST}

\paragraph{SOAP}{
    To use SOAP, we need an external component, a server. In fact with SOAP,
 we create a service, so we need a server to run it. SOAP needs some extra
 software, usually Apache Axis, to run. But we can automatically generate
 the source code and the skeleton of the different classes of the service
 for the client as well as for the server. So, such services can be used
 and discovered automatically by other pieces of software as long as we
 know where the services are available.
}

\paragraph{REST}{
    For REST-let, I use an API, \texttt{RESTlet} so we don't need extra
 software to run our server, only a library. But each time we want to
 add functionality to the server, we need to edit the code. That may
 be quite tedious regarding the existing code and so complex. As we decide
 how to use HTTP, we need create and to publish a documentation of the service
 to make it usable by other developers.
}

\paragraph{}{
    To sum up, contrary to SOAP, a REST server doesn't need much software
 to work and it is easier to use but it is harder to discover such service
 automatically. So, SOAP is heavier to use but it can be deployed and discovered
 and used (almost) automatically.
