\subsection{REST server}

\paragraph{}{
	A REST-let server is a software that handle HTTP requests to exchange data. Mainly four
 statements of the HTTP protocol is : \texttt{GET}, \texttt{POST}, \texttt{PUT} and
 \texttt{DELETE}. REST doesn't specify how to use it, so below I detail how I implement my
 REST server and specify the different requests handled. To exchange the data, I use JSON
 documents.
